# Implement Space-Themed Calendar Feature

## Context and Problem Statement

In our development of a platform tailored for developers with a keen interest in space and astronomy, there is a need for an advanced calendar system to manage coding projects, track learning progress, and handle development tasks. How can we design this feature to maximize productivity, encourage ongoing learning, and visually engage users?

## Decision Drivers

* Need for an intuitive, easy-to-use tool to manage time and projects.
* Desire to integrate a visually appealing space theme to inspire and engage users.
* Requirement to support customization and flexibility in task management.
* Users can access their calendar data from any device at any time.

## Considered Options

* Advanced calendar with customizable tags, urgency levels, and visual cues
* Basic Calendar with minimal features, like simple event creation, basic reminders and a daily view.
* An Interactive calendar with collaboration tools, like shared calendars, event voting.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Advanced Calendar with customizable tags, urgency levels, and visual cues", 
* Because it best aligns with the goals of our platform to enhance user engagement, provide flexible task management, and maintain an aesthetically pleasing interface. 
*  The advanced features are expected to improve overall user satisfaction by providing a more organized and visually appealing interface.
*  This decision is based on the need to provide a highly flexible and visually intuitive scheduling tool that meets the needs of both individual and professional users who manage complex calendars.

### Consequences

* Good, because it allows for high customization which will likely increase user satisfaction.
* Bad, because it requires more initial development time and resources.
* Good, because the visually driven design can enhance daily user interaction and reduce stress.

## Validation

The implementation will be reviewed by our team lead to ensure usability and effectiveness. Feedback will be incorporated iteratively to refine the feature.
* Verify that users can effectively create, edit, and delete tags and make sure labels are applied correctly to calendar events and are searchable.
* Conduct user testing sessions to assess the intuitiveness of the interface.
* Ensure that the application can handle a high number of events with multiple tags without significant slowdowns.

## Pros and Cons of the Options
* Pros
  * Allows users to personalize their calendars based on their specific needs, making it easier to manage and visualize their schedules.
  * With urgency and visual cues, users can quickly identify the importance and type of events, enhancing their ability to prioritize tasks and manage time more effectively.
* Cons
  * Managing a larger volume of data with multiple attributes (tags, urgency levels) might require more robust backend solutions to maintain performance.
  * Designing an intuitive and not overly complex interface that incorporates these features can be challenging.

### Advanced calendar with customizable tags, urgency levels, and visual cues

* Good, because it allows for high customization of tasks and events.
* Good, because visual cues like color changes based on task load can visually communicate the day's agenda efficiently.
* Neutral, because the complexity of the feature might require a steeper learning curve for some users.
* Bad, because it requires significant development resources.

## More Information

* This decision will be revisited after the initial release based on user feedback and usage metrics. Continuous integration practices will ensure that updates can be rolled out swiftly to adapt to user needs.
* Protection of user data should be considered in subsequent development, especially when dealing with potentially sensitive information marked by users.
* Events in the calendar can have visual differences beyond color, such as icons, fonts, or animation effects that visually convey additional information instantly.
