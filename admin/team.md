&emsp; Hello, my name is **Jiawei Huang**. I am currently a junior at **University of California, San Diego(UCSD)**, majoring in Computer Science. I participated in the project development of the [_ACM Association_](https://acmucsd.com/) in UCSD, where I learned to use ***MERN*** stack to develop web projects. I'm confident that by collaborating as a group, we can support each other in completing all course assignments and projects, and achieving an excellent grade.
