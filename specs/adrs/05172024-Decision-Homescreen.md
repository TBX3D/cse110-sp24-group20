# Implement Home Screen Feature

## Context and Problem Statement

In our development of a platform tailored for developers with a keen interest in space and astronomy, there is a need for a system where user can easily navigate to different features with straightforward actions. How can we implement such home screen align with the theme of the app, which is space and astronomy and highly improve the user flow and user experience?

## What we will have in Home Screen

* 4 planet-look buttons to navigate to 4 features
* Button 1: planet for "reflect on the day"
* Button 2: planet for "schedule your day"
* Button 3: planet for "schedule your month"
* Button 4: planet for "track a project"
* 1 Spaceship-look icon to nagivate to the corresponding buttons for appearance

## Importance of the feature

Adding this feature is very essential as this page will be the first glance for the users. The homepage design is very simplified and straightforward, so that our user can start it easily without confusions. The space and astronomy theme made the jounal more appealing to our users. And the dark mode is very vision-friendly for long-time screen using users. A well-functioned home screen is crucial for organizing the structure of the entire app.

### Pros and cons of this feature

* Good, because it is intuitive for using.
* Good, because it looks pretty and cool.
* Good, becasue it is very user friendly.
* Bad, because it does not allow much flexibilty when it comes to feature options.

## Validation

The implementation will be reviewed by our team lead to ensure usability and effectiveness. Feedback will be incorporated iteratively to refine the feature.

## More Information

This decision will be revisited after the initial release based on user feedback and usage metrics. Continuous integration practices will ensure that updates can be rolled out swiftly to adapt to user needs.
