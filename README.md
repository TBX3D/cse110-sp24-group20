## Developer Journal
### How To Use
*Ready to launch? Here's your pre-flight checklist:*
1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cse110-sp24-group20/cse110-sp24-group20
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install necessary packages:
   ```bash
   cd cse110-sp24-group20
   npm install
   ```

3. **Deploy the Journal on Vercel**: Follow these steps to deploy your developer journal website using Vercel:
   1. **Create a Vercel Account**: Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and sign up for a free account using your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account.
    
    2. **Import the Project from GitHub**:
        - In your Vercel dashboard, click on "New Project".
        - Select "Import Git Repository".
        - Authenticate with GitHub and select the developer journal repository.
    
    3. **Configure the Project**:
       - Vercel will automatically detect the framework you're using. Confirm the settings.
        - If your application requires environment variables, you can set them up in the Vercel dashboard under "Settings" -> "Environment Variables".
    
    4. **Deploy the Project**:
        - Click "Deploy" in the Vercel dashboard.
        - Once deployed, you can access your site at the URL provided by Vercel, typically in the format `https://<project-name>.vercel.app`.
    
    5. **Automatic Deployments**:
        - Vercel will automatically redeploy your site every time you push changes to the connected branch in your GitHub repository.
  
4. **Access the Journal Locally**: If you want to run the project locally, start the development server:
    ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Open your browser and navigate to `http:localhost:3000` to start using the developer journal.

### Testing Utilized and General Build Process
To ensure our project remains stable and bug-free as it travels through the cosmos, we employ a rigourous testing and review process:

- **Jest Unit Testing**: Every component is tested to ensure it functions correctly.
- **Protected Main Branch**: All changes to the main branch require human review and testing. 
- **Codacy Automatic Review**: Our code is automatically reviewed for quality and consistency.
- **Dedicated PR Review Team**: A  team of developers reviews all pull requests to maintain code integriity.
- **E2E Testing with Puppetteer**: End-to-end testing to simulate user interactions and ensure everything works as expected.
