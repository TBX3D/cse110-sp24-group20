### E2E Testing
Our team recognizes the importance of end to end “E2E” testing as it ensures the reliability of our software product. We have yet to fully incorporate E2E testing into our development process, but plan to implement it as soon as we step foot into our development process. We will first plan what parts of our software needs to be tested, and set up a testing environment. Then, we will be able to identify scenarios and make test scripts accordingly. Integrating E2E testing frameworks into our continuous integration and delivery pipelines is a priority as we understand how important it is to enable automated testing across our entire stack.
