Welcome to the repository for Team 404, a stellar project group for CSE110 at UCSD! We are on a mission to create an out-of-this-world software development project. Join us as we navigate the cosmos of coding and teamwork.

## Introduction
*Welcome aboard space cadets!*<br>
Team 404 is committed to exploring the vast universe of software development. Out project inegrate a captivating space them, offering a unique and engaging way for developers to document their journey. From designing glaxies of code to solving interstellar gugs, our project aims to provide a robust and immersive experience.

Our repository is the command center of our project. Here's your mission briefing on its layout:
- **admin/**: Contains all administrative resources, including our Team 404 branding assets, CI/CD pipeline information, meeting notes, and weekly progress reports.
-  **design in specs/**: Houses all our design boards for the homepage and each individual feature, created on Miro.
-  **docs/**: <span style="color:pink">I do not know what's in here, can someone add pls</span>
-  **img/**: Contains useful elements'images like our emoticons, the planets shown throughout the project, and other miscellaneous animations.

### Testing Utilized and General Build Process
To ensure our project remains stable and bug-free as it travels through the cosmos, we employ a rigourous testing and review process:
- **Jest Unit Testing**: Every component is tested to ensure it functions correctly.
- **Protected Main Branch**: All changes to the main branch require human review and testing. 
- **Codacy Automatic Review**: Our code is automatically reviewed for quality and consistency.
- **Dedicated PR Review Team**: A  team of developers reviews all pull requests to maintain code integriity.
- **E2E Testing with Puppetteer**: End-to-end testing to simulate user interactions and ensure everything works as expected.
