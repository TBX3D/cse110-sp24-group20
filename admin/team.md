&emsp; Hello, my name is **Jiawei Huang**. I am currently a junior at **University of California, San Diego(UCSD)**, majoring in Computer Science. I participated in the project development of the [_ACM Association_](https://acmucsd.com/) in UCSD, where I learned to use ***MERN*** stack to develop web projects. I'm confident that by collaborating as a group, we can support each other in completing all course assignments and projects, and achieving an excellent grade.

Hello! My name is Joseph Jun, and I am currently a senior at UCSD, majoring in Mathematics-Computer Science. I had an internship at Tech for Good Inc., where I worked on database and blockchain platforms. I also interned at Citmit, focusing on backend development. I hope to become a full-stack software engineer and later on, work as an AI/ML engineer. My hobbies include weightlifting, playing soccer, and basketball. A fun fact about me is that I have lived in four different countries: South Korea, Ukraine, Australia, and United States.

Hello! I'm Royce Huang, I'm a third year at UCSD studying Computer Engineering. I had a previous internship at Intel, working on platforms and automating the deployment of operating systems. I don't have much of a web development background, but I hope to learn a lot with the team, hone my skills and apply my past knowledge. Outside of academics, I love to play sports and board games with friends.

Hello! My name is Jiaying Yang and I'm a fourth-year Math-CS major. I spend my first two years of college doing an exchange program at Fudan University, China during the pandemic. So technically, this is just my second year physically at UCSD. I enjoy doing coding projects that can benefit people. I have designed an HCI web product called Gamer's Voyage and worked for UCSD Global TIES projects to build health dispatch systems in Tijuana. I also enjoy doing research and planning to become a PhD student in CSE.
