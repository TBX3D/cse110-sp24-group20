I am a first year transfer student and a computer science major. I am passionate about web development and hope to pursue IOS developing after graduating. In my free time I enjoy picking up hobbies like crocheting and practicing my latte art. I enjoy working with others and am looking forward to creating something with my peers.

&emsp; Hello, my name is **Jiawei Huang**. I am currently a junior at **University of California, San Diego(UCSD)**, majoring in Computer Science. I participated in the project development of the [_ACM Association_](https://acmucsd.com/) in UCSD, where I learned to use ***MERN*** stack to develop web projects. I'm confident that by collaborating as a group, we can support each other in completing all course assignments and projects, and achieving an excellent grade.

Hello! I'm Royce Huang, I'm a third year at UCSD studying Computer Engineering. I had a previous internship at Intel, working on platforms and automating the deployment of operating systems. I don't have much of a web development background, but I hope to learn a lot with the team, hone my skills and apply my past knowledge. Outside of academics, I love to play sports and board games with friends.
